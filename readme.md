# A Take-Home Challenge at tawk.to as a Front-end Developer
Please refer to the [`./default-version/README.md`](https://github.com/yahiarefaiea/challenge-frontend-developer-tawkto/blob/main/default-version/README.md) file (and [this PDF file](https://github.com/yahiarefaiea/challenge-frontend-developer-tawkto/blob/main/resources/frontend-test.pdf) as well) for more details about the challenge.


There are two standalone versions, a `default-version`, which covers the requirements, and an `animated-version`, which covers some extra animations. Both versions followed the same [provided design files](https://www.figma.com/file/AeDrzKULFKrTRzrH5WkMgU/Frontend-Test-1), and there's no major difference in the codebase—except in the `./src/views` directory, and most of the functionality works the same—except for some missing ones. (like a “Back” button.)


## Requirements to run
This work was only tested on Node `v8.17.0`. I downgraded my Node version when I saw all the dependencies of the [original repo](https://bitbucket.org/tawkto/frontend-test/src/master) use outdated versions. So my work will, for sure, fail to run on newer Node versions.


## Used Commands
Navigate to the required version directory then:
- Use `npm start` to run the project. Available on port `9000`.


**Note:** To be able to run both versions at the same time, kindly use a different port than `9000`.
